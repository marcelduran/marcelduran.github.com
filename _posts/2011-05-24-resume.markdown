        *   Applied performance best practices on LaTam (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, USA spanish, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Peru) frontpages, when all pages were over the SLA, dropping significantly the overall page load time achieving better results beyond the expectation, improving the final user experience and saving network bandwidth;
        *   Created and developed an internal tool during my spare time using JavaScript, YUI, PHP and MySQL, for monitoring oversized/not optimized images across Yahoo! properties, warning/emailing the responsible team with reports, improving the page performance on page load measurements;
