        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p><b>9/2008 - present, Yahoo! Inc.</b></p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>10/2009 - present, Front End Engineer, Search</i>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Performance Optimization and RTL/BiDi issues.</li>
        </ul>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>9/2008 - 10/2009, Front End Engineer, LatAm Frontpages</i>
        <ul>
            <li>Applied performance best practices on LaTam (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, USA spanish, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Peru) frontpages, when all pages were over the SLA, dropping significantly the overall page load time achieving better results beyond the expectation, improving the final user experience and saving network bandwidth.</li>
            <li>Created and developed an internal tool during my spare time using JavaScript, YUI, PHP and MySQL, for monitoring oversized/not optimized images across Yahoo! properties, warning/emailing the responsible team with reports, improving the page performance on page load measurements.</li>
            <li>Refactored the LatAm frontpages HTML, CSS and JavaScript cutting in more than half the number of requests and page sizes.</li>
            <li>Attended a performance workshop leaded by Nicole Sulivan where she compared the prior LatAm frontpage with the refactored one pointing out the excellent usage of some performance best practices.</li>
            <li>As a front end performance expert, provided performance consulting for different LatAm teams.</li>
            <li>Proposed a better solution for ads team in order to unblock page rendering and promote more parallel downloads in all properties which is already in their roadmap for next generation ads instrumentation. Proved to be better with several tests, data and charts.</li>
            <li>Code reviewed some JavaScript codes across different teams and properties usually pointing out performance caveats.</li>
            <li>Refactored the entire JavaScript code from LatAm frontpages having no warnings from JSLint code quality tool.</li>
            <li>Created and developed a hack during my spare time using JavaScript, YUI and PHP on top of an internal sprint management tool where its interface is now presented as a SCRUM board-like application helping remote members of geographically distributed teams to sync up with team's stories and tasks status. With easy and intuitive draggable interface moving tasks across columns became very efficient and also provides a presentation mode, useful for displaying the SCRUM board on a big screen.</li>
